## How To Program A Computer - Presentation

A [brief slideshow presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b_1pT_NTi1K51UKJafgZk6ReqeyPi49H2iAuveSjHaE/edit?usp=sharing) for the kids.

## How does this work?
This repository contains a small python app that scrapes information from the school lunch calendar and displays it, along with a few links and pictures. It is [deployed to heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) and built using a [lightweight python web framework called Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). It also uses:
 * [Paper CSS Framework](https://www.getpapercss.com) for style / design of the html markup.
 * [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for scraping data from the calendar page

### Tests
Tests can be run using the `nosetests` command.
